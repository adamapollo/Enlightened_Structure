_Reinventing the company as a trusted web: agile, transparent, hyperconnected_

Open source collaboration framework, designed to drastically outperform aging corporate structures. Everything runs on whuffie, pays in whuffie.  Each private knowledge center has one person/organization as it's root trust node, which has override power.  You can clone node networks (with permission), and you should if you think you can do a better job than the current root node.

Allow each member of an organization to weigh in on each issue / decision point / direction.  Each individual can weight their decisions by their degree of interest / involvement.  From these directions, the organization can move forward in a continual steering process, with complete transparency and traceability as to where each decision originated.

Decision making can occur in layers, such that everyone can contribute to high level strategy, and those closer to a given project can steer it more directly.                                              

> "It's not a matter of IF automated corporate democracy will happen, it's already happening. It's technology's promise that we can reclaim our autonomy, and dignity in work, and still find ways to converge together around a shared vision. The how and the where is the real question." --Shereef Bishay, BetterMeans
