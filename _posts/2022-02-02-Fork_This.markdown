title: Fork This
---

Remix the entire Free IP universe: the new living human knowledge conversation.  Git-style forking, applied to the worldwide body of [Creative Commons][cc] and other open source IP works, every revision archived, distributed, mirrored.  Create a massive explosion of information and creativity, all explorable in evolving diffable trees and clouds.  

Forking, diffing, and merging as the standard information conversation -- within companies, communities, working groups. Users can share any information, optionally password protected, optionally encrypted.  Networks of trust arise organically from communities of sharing, further sculpted by peer ratings.
