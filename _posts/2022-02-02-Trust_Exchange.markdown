title: Trust Exchange
---

The goal: build a global, free, open framework for exchanging trust ratings, bringing unprecedented transparency to our world's corporations and governments.  We lack transparency into our corporations and monetary systems. The current stock exchange & derivatives markets have lost our trust -- build a phoenix, a Trust Exchange, to rise out of its ashes.

The purpose of the Trust Exchange is to support the era of transparency that is already being born. Rather than trying to fight the tsunami of capitalism, we propose to use the engine of capitalism as a force for social change. Corporations too can become model citizens, with the right rewards. The Trust Exchange is a software platform designed to make this so.

The world needs more transparency. The major issues of our time are caused by obfuscation and half-truths. Suppose we lived in a world where every dollar we spent was informed by the network of our own friends and trusted advisors, in turn drawing on their own network of trusted contacts. 

As a user of the Trust Exchange, you are able to rate anything (a company, website, individual), on a flexible set of attributes. For example, you can rate a company on its environmental policies, or its integrity, or its flexibility, or any other aspect. 

When shopping online, you can view the trust ratings of the retailer, the product, the brand, etc. You can  specify (for example) that you want the lowest price for a given product, but only from sources where the entire supply chain averages 7/10 or better in the treatment of their workers. 

When viewing ratings, they will be weighted through your network of trust. For example, if I rate Steve highly in politics, and he rates IndieNews highly in politics, articles from IndieNews will percolate up to me.

Individuals could publish their trust ratings either privately (to their trusted contacts) or publicly. Publicly published ratings would be amalgamated by different organizations as trust "indexes" based on the ratings of their contributors. When influential organizations update their trust indexes, companies' stock prices will be affected, and corporations will pay attention to what affects public trust.


Solutions to our Biggest Issues
==================================================================================
Corporations tend to pursue profit, often disregarding the good of the communities and the planet. There is a promising movement in the corporate world toward social and environmental responsibility, and this trend could be greatly accelerated by increasing transparency, and allowing consumers to "vote" with their dollars. If customers were directly telling a corporation when they were (and were not) purchasing from them, then both the corporation and the shareholders would see that even from a pure profit motive, it is in their best interest to move toward the values of the consumer.

In the political realm, citizens suffer from a lack of transparency, getting their information from sources they don't really trust, simply because trusted information is not readily available. The Trust Exchange would make highly rated news media (text, audio, video) readily accessible, by filtering it through your trust network. 

Who Benefits
==================================================================================
Unlike today's (mostly proprietary) rating systems, the public at large can benefit from the ratings exposed through the Trust Exchange. We do not propose to build another silo of proprietary information. We propose to build the network that links existing trust ratings together, and inspires people to create new ratings, to share their valuable knowledge with their friends.

Anyone doing research on a purchase could tap into the publicly available ratings of relevant companies, to help them choose a product or supplier aligned with their own values. Users with rich online social networks would benefit even more, by inheriting ratings created by their trusted contacts. Corporations and governments will have much better information about the real desires and priorities of their customers and citizens.


Initial Steps
==================================================================================
 * Define a simple standard for exchanging ratings 
 * Define a "microformat" to expose ratings from any site
 * Create a free, open source crawler to collate ratings
 * Create a free, open source Trust Exchange web application, which can be used to gather trust ratings for a given organization.  Any site could collect trust ratings from its users, either by dropping a Trust Exchange widget into their existing site code, or by installing the free Trust Exchange web application.
 * Create a coalition of leading social networking and search companies, willing to implement the Trust Exchange protocol, and allow their users to share trust data across networks. This coalition could be spearheaded by Google, united by an inspiring mission, eg "The Trust Exchange -- Share Your Opinions, Save the World"
 * Add Trust Exchange ratings from your community to product, news, and media search results 

Optimal Outcome & Measuring Success
==================================================================================
Level one of success: popular product search sites have integrated trust exchange ratings, from the trust network of the current user.

Level two: influential organizations publish amalgamations of ratings from individuals and other organizations, which begin to have noticeable impact on the stock market.

Level three: the Trust Exchange begins to have an impact on elections, as your trust network automatically percolates its recommendations to you.
