Wikipedia works well for factual data, but wikis are not the best tools for collaborating on artistic creations like screenplays, poetry, or inventions. In a standard wiki-based system, creative collaborators are steered by the structure toward overwriting each other's work. The WikiNodes project, however, captures the collaborative energy of a wiki, while allowing personal ownership at the same time. Every person has their own wiki space, and they can copy and remix others' shared wiki spaces. These spaces are "node networks" in which every page is a node; thus the name "WikiNodes".

Share Alike: Viral Free IP
==========================
By default, the content people upload to WikiNodes is licensed under a viral creative commons license, so that others are free to use and remix the content, for profit or for free, as long as _they too release their content under the same license_. So... the more compelling your content, the more others are likely to create Free IP (intellectual property) based on it.

Seed What You Love
==================
I am creating open source screenplay seeds: movie scripts and movie ideas... all virally licensed, so that if (suppose) a major studio decided to make one of these movies, it too would be legally required to release the finished products (eg DVDs and other digital versions of the finished film) under the same license, allowing others to remix and use it as raw material.

What are you passionate about? Maybe you have design ideas for creating efficient solar panels: suppose you upload your ideas, and when you stop by a month later, 15,000 people have produced modified versions of the page you started. To find the most interesting edits, you use the community rating feature of WikiNodes -- where you find a highly rated version that has some great ideas and improvements. The differences from your version are highlighted for you, and you incorporate the best pieces back into your article.
