_Large Scale Parallel Creative Collaboration_

Wikis have revolutionized textual information sharing. Documents created by harnessing collective collaboration far outperform previous modes of knowledge aggregation. Wikipedia has demonstrated the incredible effectiveness of this approach.

Just as open source has changed the face of software, and wikis have changed the arena of knowledge sharing, so too is a revolution brewing as creative collaboration becomes possible across all forms of media.  WikiNodes is designed to create a boundless and self-evolving container for collective intelligence to congregate around any type of project, while retaining the edits and contributions of every individual.

In the WikiNodes collaboration platform, contributors do not have to agree on a single version; each author can maintain their own latest version.  This "branching" of creative works encourages a diversity of perspectives that can be exchanged and interwoven in a massive creative network.  Authors can create unlimited branches, easily view differences between branches, and merge in changes from other versions and authors.  The power of remixing.
