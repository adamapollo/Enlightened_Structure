Harlan is the creative force behind Enlightened Strucure -- his life's work is to transition humanity from a time of scarcity to a world of full-time creators.  As step zero of this project, Harlan designed and began implemntation of Wikinodes, a massively parallel creative collaboration engine, designed to bring the explosion of crowdsourcing energy to the world's creative projects that Wikipedia has brought to factual information.

Harlan brings a decade of software development experience together with a diverse background including many years of work in various personal transformation systems.  In addition to software, he is working on an open-IP licensed science fiction movies with spiritual punch, as well as a worldwide network of distributed trust ratings, which, in its full realization, has the potential to reinvent both democracy and capitalism as engines of social change.

Adam awakened to an akashic library of sacred geometry, magic, metaphysics, energetics, and holistic system dynamics at the age of 15.  He has since taught many apprentices and numerous workshops across the spectrum of metaphysical and occult arts.                                                                              

He designed the interface that

advanced structural models of energy in theoretical physics that would

Adam is dedicated to Earth healing and Global
environmental, social, and economic sustainability.
